Usage:
* make
* ./main3 to see the possible commandline options to generate fillings of borders of patches
* ./canonicalizeplanargraph outputs some kind of canonical form, given a file containing patches
Test programs:
* ./captest.sh
  Compares output of the main3 program with the 'tubetype' program for fillings of the borders (01)^k
  For this to work, add the 'tubetype' executable to the directory 'caps' (or edit the paths in the script)
  Its parameters can be configured in the form of a range of 'k' that will be tested
* ./easycompare.sh
  Compares output of the main3 program with the 'boundary' program for fillings of all borders within a range of borderlengths and number of pentagons
  For this to work, add the 'boundary' and 'hydrocarbon' executables to the 'boundary' directory (or edit the paths in the script)
  The parameters for the range of lengths and pentagons can be configured by editing the file, just like the output that will be tested (growth pairs, isomerisation patches/pairs)
Note on the test programs:
  The test scripts can claim the outputs are OK in case the canonicalize program is buggy
